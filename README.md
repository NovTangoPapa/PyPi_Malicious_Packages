# PyPi_Malicious_Packages
This is a collection of packages which are known to be malicious which have since been removed from the PyPi repository but still may be present in your environment.  I saw multiple reports of malicious packages over the last couple weeks and wanted to compile them all into one spot.  Please add on as needed.

Some notes about the CSV:
- ioc's are seperated by pipes
- These were collected from various sources which are listed in the source column

Happy Hunting
